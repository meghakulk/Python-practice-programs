PROBLEM STATEMENT:The game() lets user to play a game and returns the score as an integer.You need to read a file "Hi-score.txt"which is either blank or contains the previous hiscore you need to write a program to update 
import random

def game():
    print("You are playing the game:")
    score = random.randint(1,62)
    #fetch hiscore
    with open("hiscore.txt") as f:
        hiscore = f.read()
        if(hiscore != ""):
            hiscore = int(hiscore)
        else:
            hiscore = 0
            
    print(f"Your score: {score}")
    if(score>hiscore):
        #write this hiscore to file
        with open("hiscore.txt","w") as f:
            f.write(str(score))
            
    return score
    
game()
output:You are playing the game
        Your score: 14
